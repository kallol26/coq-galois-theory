Hi Tom,

  I've made fairly good progress again this week.  Here are the highlights.

1) I've got a polynomial ring structure and important theorems about
   the degree function and evaluation of a polynomial at a point.

2) I decided to start hacking up a signature for the files, as 
   reading the Coq scripts is getting really confusing.  I really
   like what I've got so far, a signature for rings up to
   the definition of isomorphism.  I didn't realize until a few
   minutes ago that you could have [Section] commands inside
   signatures, so the arguments are all explicit and a bit long,
   but otherwise it's much nicer to read.  I think I should be
   able to make it to the entire signature up to the main theorems
   we're aiming for by tomorrow or Wednesday.  That will be great.

Things to note:

A) Following Gonthier, I made all rings be able to distinguish
   their 0 element.  Even for eqTypes where this doesn't immediately
   yield classical logic, it's still much nicer than an explicit
   zero test.  The proof of the ring structure on polynomials is
   short and sweet.  The first time I tried, in the usual way, 
   was really, really ugly.  Apparently it is a well known
   situation, that those proofs are a pain.  

   Thus, the ring.v file gives general facts about rings, but
   our main focus will be on nzring.v.  It seems like a reasonable
   enough assumption that you can distinguish 0.  If people complain,
   there is a hack to turn a nzring into a ring, so there's no
   loss of generality, but the translation is not pretty.

Plan for this week:

1) Finish Galois signature.

2) Euclidean algorithm for polynomials.

3) More detailed dates on the time-line.  (postponed from last week)

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Sean
