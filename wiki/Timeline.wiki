Theorem numbers are from Milne's notes on 
[http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/math594f.html Fields and Galois Theory]

These dates are rather arbitrary.  The process of theorem proving is still
black magic: seeming (but not actual) trivialities such as the associativity of polynomial multiplication
can easily take longer than major results that rely on them.  Being so, it is useful to have a rough schedule to follow.  This will no doubt change as the summer progresses.  At
least we can list all the milestones here.
