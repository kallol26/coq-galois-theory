Hi Tom,

  I've made fairly good progress this week.  Here are the highlights.

1) I set up a wiki page with all the necessary definitions and theorems
needed for the project.  Each will be linked to a coqdoc definition at
my website.  The ones marked "Yes" for being done all link to the right
file, but the coqdoc html sectioning doesn't seem to be working properly.
It doesn't always find the right location in the file.  At any rate,
it is a good way to monitor progress.  

2) I've done a bunch of work, ~1000 lines, on basic rings.  This is
in the file [ring.v].  It includes the definition of rings, domains,
fields, homomorphisms and isomorphisms, along with a number of lemmas
about each.  

3) I've set up some a small library of helpful routines, one for
classical logic and one for constructive logic.  Since equality
on subrings depends on classical logic though, we have a strongly
classical theory.  In fact, I didn't hesitate to include a Hilbert
choice principle and proof irrelevance.  

As you'll see from the time-line, I didn't get most of the definitions
complete.  This is because I wanted to get a good start on the most
basic definitions.  

Plan for this week:

1) Polynomials, definition and ring structure

2) More of the definitions and Rotman theorem statements.

3) More detailed dates on the time-line.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Sean
